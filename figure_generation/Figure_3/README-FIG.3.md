# Figure 3 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 3:
* Figure 3A: Numbers of cis-eQTLs and cis-sQTLs per tissue, stratified by variant type, at a 5% FDR threshold.
* Figure 3B: Distribution of relative distance between eQTL variants and the transcription start sites (TSS) of their associated genes.
* Figure 3C: The high correlation of eQTL effect sizes between GTOP and GTEx in matched tissues.
* Figure 3D: Overlap of eGenes detected by small variant (replaced by SNV)-eQTLs, SV-eQTLs, and TR-eQTLs.
* Figure 3E: Disease-associated TRs previously reported to alter molecular phenotypes (nominal _P_ ≤ 0.05) across GTOP tissues. distribution of copy number variation for these TRs in the GTOP cohort, colored by genomic context.
* Figure 3F: Example of a pathogenic TR significantly associated with expression of MUC1.
* Figure 3G: Distribution of the  number of tissues sharing the same eQTLs.
