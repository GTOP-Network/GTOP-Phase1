# Figure 4 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 4:
* Figure 4A: Geographic frequencies of GTOP independent eQTLs across across four continental groups.
* Figure 4B: Scatter plot of allele frequencies in GTOP versus European population.
* Figure 4C: The proportion of fd-QTLs categorized as unobserved in EUR and rare in EUR, stratified by the absolute allele frequency difference (|ΔAF|) between EAS and NFE.
* Figure 4D: The number of genes regulated by fd-QTLs across different GTOP tissues.
* Figure 4E: LocusZoom plots (top) and gene structure diagram (bottom) showing colocalization between urticaria signal and pb-QTLs.
* Figure 4F: Number of he-QTLs in each GTOP tissue.
* Figure 4G: Boxplot of he-QTLs z-score derived from GTOP and GTEx data.
* Figure 4H: Distribution of the size of 95% CSs and comparisons between the cross-ancestry fine-mapping (GTEx+GTOP) and single-population fine-mapping.
* Figure 4I: Proportion of CSs with best (maximum) PIP greater than 0.8 across all 95% CSs in each analysis.
* Figure 4J: The distribution of PIP for all variants in the fine-mapped CSs associated with eGene ABO in liver.
