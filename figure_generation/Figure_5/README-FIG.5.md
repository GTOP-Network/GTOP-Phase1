# Figure 5 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 5:
* Figure 5A: Histogram shows the R2 correlation of SV-eQTL or TR-eQTL and their best-tagging SNV genotypes in individual tissues.
* Figure 5B: The number of fine-mapped variants in 95% credible sets (CS) and the total number of fine-mapped CS in each tissue.
* Figure 5C: CS number across GTOP tissue. stacked bar plots show the proportion of CS with or without SV/TR and with SV/TR as lead from joint fine-mapped CS.
* Figure 5D: Overall number of fine mapped eQTL credible sets containing SV, TR, or only SNV.
* Figure 5E: Enrichment of SV and TR as fine-mapped causal variants in credible sets selected with gradient PIP scores.
