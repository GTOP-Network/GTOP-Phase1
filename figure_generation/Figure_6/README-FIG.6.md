# Figure 6 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 6:
* Figure 6A: GWAS enrichment of cis-eQTLs and cis-sQTLs measured with different approaches.
* Figure 6B: Stacked bars show the number of colocalized GWAS loci by eQTL (green), sQTL (blue), and both (purple). Venn diagram showing the number of colocalized genes and SMR detected genes.
* Figure 6C: Proportion of GTOP colocalized genes compares with those from the GTEx, the JCTF, and MAGE.
* Figure 6D: LocusCompare plots illustrating the colocalization between ADAP1 cis-eQTLs and Crohn's disease in GTOP , but not in GTEx. 
* Figure 6E: Proportion of GWAS variants overlapping QTLs.
* Figure 6F: Proportion of GWAS risk variants overlapping with QTL variants, stratified by variant frequency across ancestry groups.
* Figure 6G: Upset plot characterizes the number of colocalized signals containing fine-mapped SV/TRs.
* Figure 6H: LocusZoom plots for breast cancer GWAS signal and CASP8 SNV-eQTL signal and SV-eQTL signal.
