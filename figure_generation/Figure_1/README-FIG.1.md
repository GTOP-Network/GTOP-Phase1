# Figure 1 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 1:
* Figure 1B: Principal component analysis (PCA) of genotypes from GTOP, GTEx, and 1KGP, illustrating continental ancestry clusters. 
* Figure 1C: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of GTOP RNA-seq samples based on gene expression profiles
* Figure 1D: Hierarchical clustering of tissues based on gene expression.
* Figure 1E: The cumulative length in the genome and variant counts of genome-wide variants. 
* Figure 1F: Number of three types of variants per genome from long-read sequenced samples (LRS) and matched short-read sequenced samples
* Figure 1G-I: Comparison of total number of small variants (g), structural variants (DEL, deletion; INS, insertion) (h), and tandem repeats (i) between LRS and SRS supported genotypes.
