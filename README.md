# GTOP: Genotype Tissues-Plasma Omics Project

GTOP is a long-read multi-omics atlas comprising transcriptomic and genetic variation data from 33 tissues of 160 healthy Chinese donors. The project expands tissue coverage beyond existing multi-tissue resources and enables systematic characterization of regulatory variants, complex genomic features, and transcript isoform diversity that are poorly captured by short-read sequencing. As a population-representative resource for East Asians, GTOP addresses a major gap in current functional genomics references and supports studies of regulatory variation, disease mechanisms, and population-specific genetic architecture.
## Data Access

### Raw reads

Newly generated sequencing data for the 160 individuals is available on the Sequence Read Archive (Accession: **[PRJNA851328](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA851328)**).

### Processed data

Processed gene expression matrices and QTL mapping results (as well as a host of other downstream data) are currently available on Website (**[GTOP Website link](https://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/GTOP/expression)**).

If you are having trouble accessing these data, please feel free to contact us to explore other options.

## Code

Code used for data processing and downstream analyses is made available in the [analysis_pipeline/](https://github.com/GTOP-Network/GTOP-Phase1/tree/main/analysis_pipeline) directory, along with READMEs describing how each script is run.

Code used to produce major figures/panels in the manuscript is made available in the [figure_generation/](https://github.com/GTOP-Network/GTOP-Phase1/tree/main/figure_generation) directory.

READMEs are provided for all code.
